# so... we started construction of our new home

stress abound!

but i realized it's okay as long as the family is together!?

okay, so devops meetups also happend... twice... and I wasn't able to attend both.

still not in the mood to learn with peers lately.

but I'm making up for all the learnings i missed.

just installed docker, used it to install hangups :) and started learning how to dev the docker way.

thankful to Ludwig for the help.

looking forward to more!
