# Not feeling well

body clock messed up...

even kahel's sleeping time is getting worse...

i need to get my annual physical exam today...

i need discipline

anyway, i scrapped everything in my ubuntu laptop to install a clean ubuntu server. interesting things so far:
 - needed to setup audio from scratch (no sounds intially!)
 - there was a scan for network at boot time, disabled it because it forces to wait for the network before proceeding 
 - i made a new git repository for my dotfiles and a gist for the dev packages installation process for nodejs, ruby (jekyll), and python
