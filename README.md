# notes

this repository contains my notes which are organized into their own directories. this note (as well as all other notes in this repository) is a personal note. this is by no means a definitive authority on the topic. if you do not like what you read, you can always write your own or, better yet, contribute to this note by creating a pr. i welcome all contributors. :)

here i keep technical notes and knowledge base which i think contributes to my growth professionally. i also do maintain a [blog](https://blog.ayoayco.com) where i publish stuff that are leaning more toward my opinion and other personal things.
