# Notes

This repository contains my notes which are organized into their own directories. This note (as well as all other notes in this repository) is a personal note. This is by no means a definitive authority on the topic. If you do not like what you read, you can always write your own or, better yet, contribute to this note by creating a PR. I welcome all contributors. :)
