# Notes

This repository contains my notes which are organized into different topics with their own directories. The notes in this repository are personal. These are by no means definitive authority on the topics. If you do not like what you read here, you can always write your own or, better yet, contribute to here by creating a PR. I welcome all contributors. :)

Here I keep technical notes and knowledge base which I think contributes to my growth professionally. I also do maintain a [blog](https://blog.ayoayco.com) where I publish stuff that are leaning more toward my opinion and other personal things.
