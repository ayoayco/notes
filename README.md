## Disclaimer
This repository contains my notes which are organized into different topics with their own directories. The notes in this repository are personal. These are by no means definitive authority on the topics--not even a valid resource to be cited, in my honest opinion. They are just my notes. If you do not like what you read here, you can always write your own or, better yet, contribute here by letting me know about your [Issues](https://github.com/ayoayco/notes/issues) or creating a [Pull Request](https://github.com/ayoayco/notes/pulls). I welcome all contributors. :)

With that, all notes here are evolving depending on my learnings.

I also maintain a [tech blog](http://fullhacker.com)
