# Open Source - Where to start?

Right now, I really do not have the creds to talk about this with authority. The only reason I want to write about this is the interest I am having lately in contributing to the open source community. 

I have been using open source since college, studying Computer Science, and I have released a number of projects over at [Github](http://github.com/ayoayco). But up until now, I have not contributed in any other open source project (except maybe that one time in college where we were required to do so...)

In this note I will document my journey into contributing to the open source community.


## Wet your apetite.

Here is a list of communities/places I have found over the web where I get my interest in open source all fired up.

1. [Reddit's r/opensource](https://www.reddit.com/r/opensource/) - To see what's the latest in the community.
2. [Github Trending](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rubik.github) - To browse through interesting repositories in Github.
3. [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com) - To see what other developers are confused about... and sometimes to answer questions.
