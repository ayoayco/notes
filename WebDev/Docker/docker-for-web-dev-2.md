# Docker for Web Dev Notes Part 2

For Windows of Mac, there is a docker-machine that runs a Linux VM on a virtualbox. This Linux VM runs docker and you communicate with this docker via docker-machine commands.

On Linux, you don't need this. Your machine runs docker.

## Docker Client

The docker client communicates with the docker daemon.

Here are some Docker Client commands:
1. docker pull [image name]
2. docker run [image name]
3. docker images
4. docker ps
